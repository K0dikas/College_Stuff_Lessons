- **Communication** - is the act of `transmitting` and `exchanging` between *people*, *people and objects*, and *objects and objects through various media and actions*.
	- The `ULTIMATE PURPOSE` of communication technology is to help people communicate more efficiently and create better lives from it.
- **Internet** - is the `largest computer network in the world`. Its *predecessor*, *Advanced Research Projects Agency Network* `ARPAnet`, was born in `1969`.
- **Network Communication** - refers to *communication* between *terminal devices* through a *computer network*.

##### What is a signal?
- `Means of Communication`**:** A *sign* or *indication* that conveys *information* about something or that tells someone to do something.
- `Communicated Information`**:** An *event* or *act*, which shows that something exists or that gives information about something.
- `Electronics Transmitted Information`**:** *Detectable physical quantity* or *impulse* `as a voltage, current, or magnetic field strength` by which *messages* or *information* can be transmitted via `telegraphy`, `telephony`, `radio`, `radar`, or `television`.

##### Examples of Signals
- `Electrical Signals`**:** **Voltages and currents in a circuit**
- `Acoustic Signals`**:** **Audio or speech signals**
- `Video Signals`**:** **Intensity variations in an image**
- `Biological Signals`**:** **Sequence of bases in a gene**
- `Noise`**:** `Interference` **Unwanted and undesired form of signal**
	- The `MAIN PURPOSE` of the *signal* is to ensure that the `synchronization` between the *sender* and *receiver* over a physical medium is maintained, as well as support transmission of the data signal in a form that can be interpreted by both the *sender* and *receiver*.

##### Attributes of a Wave
- `Waves`**:** *Disturbances* in that energy to travel **through a medium** `from one location to another`.
- `Wavelength`**:** *Horizontal distance* of a wave *from a point* to the *corresponding point* on the *next wave*. This is measured in **meters** `m` in `SI`.
- `Amplitude`**:** *Vertical distance from a given point on the wave from the* `Horizontal axis`. In `layman's terms`, it is the *height* `above` and `below` the *x-axis*. This is measured in `volts`, `amperes`, or `watts`, depending on the type of signal.
- `Phase`**:** The *position* of the *waveform* relative to `time zero`; measurement of the *delay of the wave* relative to some fixed reference point or another `sine wave`.
- `Frequency`**:** *Number of waves* made `per second` or as `cycles per second`. The *reciprocal* of the period to complete **one** `1` wave cycle.
	- **Unit** for `frequency` is in **Hertz** `Hz`; `1` **Hz** means `1` **cycle per second** `cps`.
- `Period`**:** The *amount of time* `expressed in seconds` required to complete *one* `1` full cycle.

##### General Categories of Waves
- `Analog (short for "analogous) wave`**:** Both the *amplitude* and *time* continuously vary over their respective *intervals* that results in a `wavy characteristic`. **Examples** of this *wave* include the `human voice` and `music`.

###### Transmission Types
