###### What is Quantitative Analysis?
- It is the *act of selecting a preferred course of action* among `alternatives`.
- Also known as *decision-making*.
- A `scientific approach` to managerial decision making in which `raw data` are processed and manipulated to produce *meaningful information*.
- `Raw Data` **>** `Quantitative Analysis` **>** `Meaningful Information`
- `Garbage In` **>** `Process` **>** `Garbage Out`

###### Types of Data
- **Alphanumeric** - Combination of `numbers` and `letters`.
- **Text** - `Sentences` and `paragraphs` used in *written communication*.
- **Image** - `Graphics`, `Shapes`, `Figures`, `etc`.
- **Audio** - `Human voice` and *other sounds*.

###### The Quantitative Analysis Approach
1. **Defining the problem**
2. **Developing a model**
3. **Acquiring input data**
4. **developing a solution**
5. **Testing the solution**
6. **Analyzing the result**
7. **Implementing the result**


###### Possible Problems in Defining the Problem
- **Conflicting Viewpoints**
- **Impacts on other departments**
- **Beginning Assumption**
- **Solution Outdated**

##### 2. Formulation and Construction of the Model of the Problem
- In this `phase`, the operations research analyst, express the problem from *verbal* and *qualitative terms* into a `model` that represents systems, processes or environment usually in the forms of *equations*, *relationships* or *formulas*.
- `Models` - Are *representations of real objects* or *situations* and can be presented in various forms.

`TYPES OF MODELS`
	- **Iconic** `(Imitation)` **Model** -  It is referred as *physical replicas* of a `real objects`.
	- **Analog** `(Linear)` **Model** - It is a model that is *physical in form*, but `do not have the same physical appearance` as the object being modeled.
	- **Mathematical** `Symbolic` **Model** - It is a model that uses *symbols* and *mathematical relationships* or *expressions* to represent a `problem`.

##### 3. Acquire Data
`TYPES OF DATA`**:**
	- **Qualitative Data** - It is about *attributes* and *properties*; information that `cannot actualy be measured`. It is concerned with the data that is observable in terms of `smell`, `appearance`, `taste`, `feel`, `texture`, `gender`, `nationality`, and so on and is represented either in a *verbal/narrative* format.
	- **Quantitative Data** - It is the data that can be `measured` and `expressed` in *numerical terms*. It is concerned with measurements such as `height`, `weight`, `volume`, `length`, `size`, `humidity`, `speed`, `age`, etc. The *tabular* and *diagrammatic presentation of data* is also possbile.

##### 5. Experiments and Observational Study
- `Experiment Study` - deliberately *assigns* subjects to various treatments for *studying the reasons* for changes in the *output response*.
- `Observational Study` - *Collect data* in a way that `doesn't` directly *interfere* with how the data arise, i.e. merely *"observe"*.

##### 6. Planning and Conducting Surveys
- `Independent Variables `**-** **(aka Experimental Factors, Controllable Factors)** **-** It is the factor that causes a `change` in the `dependent variable`. It can be thought of an as an *intervention* or a *treatment*.
- `Dependent Variables` **-** **(aka Classification Factors, Uncontrollable Factors)** **-** It is what we `hope to change through the experiment.` This is the *"effect"* in *cause and effect relationship*.

###### Experiment Designs
- `Completely Randomized Design` - This is when *each person* or *object* upon which the *treatment is applied* is *assigned* to a treatment completely at *random*.
- `Matched-Pair Design` - This is when the *person* or *object* upon which the *treatment is applied* 
- `Randomized Block Design` - This is used when the *person* or *object* upon which *treatment is applied* are divided into *homogeneous groups* called `blocks`.

###### Validity Evaluation
- `Internal Validity` - It occurs when *causal relationship* between the variables being studied can be *determined*.
- `External Validity` - It occurs when *conclusion* can be *generalized* to other *people*, *times* and *contexts*.
- `Construct Validity` - It demonstrates that the assessment is actually *measuring the quality of an instrument or experimental design*.
- `Conclusion Validity` - It occurs when a *relationship* of some kind `between` the *two variables being examined can be found*.

###### Experiment Operation
- `Preparation` - It is concerned with *preparing the subjects* as well as the material needed.
- `Execution` - It is concerned with ensuring that the *experiment* is conducted *according to the plan* and *design of the experiment*, which includes `data collection`.
- `Data Validation` - It is concerned with ensuring that the *actual collected data is correct* and *provide a valid picture of the experiment*.

###### Analysis and Interpretation
- `Descriptive Statistics` - *Provides information* about the *properties* of the *produced data* and allows readers to understand important things about it from a *single glance*.
- `Data Set Reduction`
- `Hypothesis Testing` - Allows us to *estimate* how likely it is that our *results* were produced by chance rather than a *genuine experimental effect*.

###### Presentation and Package
- This include primarily `documentation of the results`, which can be made either through a *research paper* for *publication*, etc.

##### Possible Problems in Acquiring Data
- `Accounting Data` - Usually *sensitive data* such as `cash flows` and `turnovers`, hence, it's *not open for public research*. Some cost data requirements needed by an analyst was never collected in the first place, hence, analyst may  find it *hard to obtain*.
- `Validity of Data` - We tend to *manipulate data* `according to our own purposes` to make it look *"good and clean"*. Yet, the *validity of result* rest on the *validity of the input data*.

###### Develop a Solution
- This requires *manipulation of the model variables* in order to determine the solution that is practical and can be *implemented*.

`Manipulation can be done by:`
- **Solving Equations**
- **Trial and Error**
- **Complete Enumeration**
- **Using an Algorithm**

###### Analyze the results and Perform Sensitivity Analysis
- `Analyzing Data` - It involves *examining the collected information* in ways that reveal the relationships, patterns, etc.
- `Sensitivity Analysis` - It allows a series of *"what-if"* questions to be answered for it to determine *possible changes* in the various parameters of the *original problem*.

##### There are two (2) potential roadblocks that Quantitative analysts face in developing a solution
- `Hard to understand mathematics` - There is a `false notion` in us that if someone thinks complicatedly or elaborately think well. That is not the case always, `mathematics` always *shuns a lot of people, even managers*.
- `Only one answer is limiting` - `QA` models tend to give *one solution to a problem*. One way to offset this is to come up with *alternative scenarios* or *sensitivies* to give managers options to choose from. In this way, other *non-quantitative factors* may be considered and the cost implication of deviating from the *optimal solution is known*.
