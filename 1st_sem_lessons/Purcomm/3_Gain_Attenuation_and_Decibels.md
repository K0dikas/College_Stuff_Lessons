- **Signal** is an electromagnetic or electrical current representing the information or data it carries from the source it was produced to its destination; such examples include analog and digital signals.
- Electronic circuits process and manipulate signals to achieve a desired result, such as *gain* and *attenuation*.

###### Gain
- Means *amplification* in a manner that if a signal is applied to a circuit, and its output has a *greater amplitude* than the *input signal*, then the circuit has *gain*.
