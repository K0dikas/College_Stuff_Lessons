- **Signal** is an electromagnetic or electrical current representing the information or data it carries from the source it was produced to its destination; such examples include analog and digital signals.
- Electronic circuits process and manipulate signals to achieve a desired result, such as *gain* and *attenuation*.

###### Gain
- Means *amplification* in a manner that if a signal is applied to a circuit, and its output has a *greater amplitude* than the *input signal*, then the circuit has *gain*.
- **Voltage Output** divided by **Voltage Input**.


###### Attenuation
- It is the loss fed by a circuit or component. 
- **Stages**, reduce the amplitude of a signal rather than increase it.
- A circuit has *attenuation* if the output signal is lower in amplitude than the input and if circuits with attenuation have a gain of less than 1.


###### Combined Gain and Attenuation
- **Cascading circuits** and components with gain and attenuation are common in communication systems. Such the loss of a circuit can be compensated by adding a stage of amplification that cancels or offsets it.


###### Decibels
- The *gain* or *attenuation* of a circuit is expressed in decibels *(dB)* which is a unit of measurement to express the hearing response of the human ear to sound levels. It is *one-tenth* of a bel.


#### The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- **Electromagnetic waves** are signals that oscillate at an extremely low or high frequency, such as the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields varying at a specific rate.
- Measured in *hertz (Hz)*, from **Heinrich Hertz**.

###### Frequency
- It's the *number of cycles* of a repetitive wave that happen in a given period.

###### Wavelength
- It's the distance occupied by *one cycle (a)* of a wave, and it's expressed in *meters* wherein *one (1) meter (m)* is equal to *39.37 inches*.
- The wavelength of a signal is represented by a *lambda (Î»)*, a Greek letter, and is calculated by dividing the speed of light by the frequency of *f* of the wave in *hertz*.

###### The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- The range of *electromagnetic signals* in all frequencies, including all electrical and electronic signals, radiates into free space but excludes signals carried by cables.
- It defines all kinds of lights, even those human eyes cannot see, and is vital to how people sense and experience the world.
