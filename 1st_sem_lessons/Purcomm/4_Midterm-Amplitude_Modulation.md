- **Modulation** is the process of *converting* `raw message data into digital signals or waves` over a modulator to optimize transmission.
- This process increases the strength of the signal to have `maximum reach`.
- *Modulation* is done to improve signals often unsuitable for the transmission device.

- **Carrier signal** - The `steady waveform` in terms of *amplitude* `(height)` and *frequency*.
- **Modulating signal** - The message that must be `transmitted`.
- **Modulated signal** - The `output signal` after the *process*.


- One way to get a `high-frequency signal` to carry a `low-frequency signal` is by **amplitude modulation**.

###### Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- It is a `modulation process` focused on *modulating* or *changing the signal's amplitude*.
- A device or a circuit can convert `data` into an `electrical signal` in an AM communications system.
- The messages `modulates` the *carrier signal* to produce the AM signal.
- The *AM'S signal* will increase or decrease based on the `waveform` of the message signal.
- Characteristics:
	-  The `carrier frequency` stays `constant` during the `modulation process`, but its *amplitude* `(height)` changes based on the *modulating signal*.
	- An increase in the *amplitude* of the modulating signal `increases the amplitude` of the carrier.
	- Changes in the `positive` and `negative peaks` of the carrier wave *depend* on the modulating signal.
	- An `imaginary line` connects the `positive` and `negative peaks` of the carrier waveform. This imaginary line is called an *"envelope"*, which is the `dashed line`.
	- An `increase/decrease` in the amplitude of the modulating signal causes an `increase/decrease` in the `positive` and `negative peaks` of the carrier amplitude.
- **Time domain signals** are `voltage` or `current` variations that occur over time and are displayed on an *oscilloscope screen*.

###### Sidebands or (side frequencies)
- During the *modulation* of a carrier wave by a modulating signal, *new signals* are `generated at different frequencies` as part of the process.
- Are the `sum` and `difference` of the carrier and modulating frequencies, such as: `(formula incoming)`
- Are illustrated in a **frequency domain** where the `horizontal axis` represents *frequency*, and the `vertical axis` represents the *signal's magnitude*, whether in `voltage`, `current`, or `power amplitude`. 

###### Modulation Index and Percentage Modulation (Frenzel, 2022)
- The *amplitude* of the modulating signal `must always be less than` the *amplitude of the carrier*.
- Otherwise, `distortion` will occur and will transmit `incorrect information`, thus making the relationship between the *amplitude* of the *modulating signal* and the *carrier signal* important.
- This is known as the **modulation index** `(m)`, also referred to as *the degree of modulation* or *modulating factor/coefficient*.
- To get the `percentage of modulation`, multiply the *modulation index* by `100`.

###### Modulation index using Oscilloscope
- An **oscilloscope** can be used to derive the `modulation index (m)` by measuring the values of the modulation and carrier voltages and then calculating the ratio.
- When the *AM signal* is seen on an `oscilloscope`, the *modulation index* is computed from `Vmax` and `Vmin`.
- The `peak value` of the *modulating signal* `Vm` is half the difference between the peak `Vmax` and trough `(Vmin)` values such as:
- `Vmax is the peak value` while `Vmin is the lowest`, or the *trough* of the *modulated wave*.
- `Vmax` is also `one-half of the peak value` of the *AM signal*

- The values for `Vmax (p - p)` and `Vmin (p - p)` can be *obtained* from an `oscilloscope screen` and be used to computed the *modulation index*. Additionally, the depth of *AM* is more expressed as the percentage of modulation than as a fractional value.
- *Subtracting* `Vmin` and `Vmax` gives the `peak-to-peak value`  of the *modulating signal*, wherein *one-half* is the *peak value*. On the other hand, the *peak value of the carrier signal* `Vc` is the `average` of the `Vmax` and `Vmin` values.
