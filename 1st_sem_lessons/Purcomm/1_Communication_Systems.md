- *Communication* - is exchanging any type of message between a ==sender== and ==receiver==. It can be a plain conversation between friends about their thought, ideas and feelings *(Verbal)*.
- *Communication Systems* - Refers to communication that uses a ==transmitter==, ==communication channel==, and ==receiver==.
	- The *message* is called *information*, or an *intelligence signal*, in the form of an electronic signal.

###### Transmitter
- The ==first step== in sending a message is to convert it into an electronic form suitable for transmission.
- Common examples include the following:
	- A *microphone* is used to convert the sound to an electronic audio signal for voice messages.
	- For *TV*, a camera converts light information in the scene to a video signal.
	- In *computer systems*, the messages is typed on a keyboard and converted to binary codes stored in memory or transmitted serially.
	- *Physical characteristics* such as ==temperature==, ==pressure==, and ==light intensity== used transducers to convert them into electronic signals.

###### Communication Channel
- It is the ==medium== wherein an electronic signal is send from ==one point to another==.
- Several types of communication channels include:
	- *Electrical Conductor* - a material that conducts electricity and allows the flow of charge such metals and metal alloys.
	- *Optical Media* - Can be a fiber-optic cable or light pipe that carries the message on a light wave.
	- *Free Space* - The resulting system is known as radio when free space is the channel. Radio is the term applied to any wireless communication from point to point.
	- *Others* - Other communication channels are used in special communication systems such as ==sonar==; water is used as the medium.
		- *Passive Sonar* - *listens* for underwater sounds with sensitive ==hydrophones==.
		- *Active Sonar* - Use an echo-reflecting technique for determining how far away objects underwater are and in what direction they are moving.

###### Receiver
- It is a set of electronic components and circuits that accept transmitted messages from the channel and translate them back, which humans understand.
- A receiver contains the following:
	- *Amplifiers* - Produce an increased version of the input signal.
	- *Oscillators* - Produce a continuous, repeated, and alternating waveform without input.
	- *Mixers* - Combine two or more electronic signals into one or two output signals.
	- *Tuned Circuits* or *Resonant Circuits* - Combine an inductor and capacitor to make a circuit responsive to a frequency.
	- *Filters* - A circuit capable of amplifying specific frequencies while attenuating others.


###### Block Diagram of Communication Systems
- Consists of ==five (5)== blocks:
	1. *Information Source*
	2. *Transmitter*
	3. *Channel*
	4. *Receiver*
	5. *Destination*
- Starts with the ==information source== wherein the message originates, whether in the form of words, codes, symbols, or sound signals, and goes through a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver, and ends with the ==destination== block, which is the final stage that receives the messages signal and processes it to understand the information.
