- **Electronic communications** are categorized as whether they are ==one-way== or ==two-way== transmissions and ==analog== or ==digital signals==.

###### Simplex Communication
- Considered the *simplest way electronic communication is conducted*.
- Transmitted from one device to another.
- But the *receiver* cannot send any information back to the transmitting device, such as ==TV broadcasting== and ==remote control==.

- A simplex can be a *downlink* or *uplink*.
- **Downlink** - satellite transmits the television programming to the home antenna and the television set, but the TV doesn't talk back.
- **Uplink** - Satellite gets its programming material from a ground-based TV station that transmits to the satellite.

###### Duplex Communication
- Can be a *full duplex* or a *half-duplex*.
- **Full duplex** - A ==two-way communication== wherein people communicating can talk and listen simultaneously, such as using a telephone.
- **Half duplex** - A ==two-way communication==, but the direction alternates, and the communicating parties take turns transmitting and receiving, such as the *transceiver*. *Examples*: Walkie-talkie.

###### Analog Signal
- It is a *continuously* varying *voltage* or *current*.
	- **Sine Wave (tone)**
	- **Voice**
	- **TV signal**
- A **sine wave** is a single-frequency analog signal.
- **Voice** and **video voltages** are analog signals that vary based on sound or light variations similar to the information being transmitted.

###### Digital Signal
- ==DO NOT CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY== but vary in discrete increments compared to analog signals.
- **Examples**: telegraph (morse code), continuous-wave (CW) code, and serial binary code.

###### Telegraph (Morse Code)
- A system for short (dots) and long (dashes) signals to represent letters and numbers.
	- The length of a *dot* is *one unit*, while a *dash* is equivalent to *three units*.
	- The space between parts of the same letter is *one unit*.
	- The space between letters is *three units*.
	- The space between words in *seven units*.
###### Conversion to Telegraph using Morse Code
- *Short mark* represents the dot
- *Long mark* represents the dash
- *Space* represents the space between the unit

###### Continuous-Wave (CW) Code
- Also knows as *radio telegraphy*, a *sine wave* signal is turned off and on for short or long duration to represents the dots and dashes.
###### Conversion to CW Signal
- The *Morse code* value of the letter/number should be obtained first
- A *short sine wave* duration represents a *dot*
- A *long sine wave* duration represents a *dash*

###### Binary Codes and ASCII
- Represent *numbers*, *letters*, or *special symbols* in computers transferred serially through a wire, radio, or optical medium.
- **ASCII or The American Standard code for Information Interchange** is the most commonly used digital communication code.
	- The *binary value* of the letter/number should be obtained first.
	- *1s* are placed concerning the given *height*/*amplitude*.
	- *0s* are placed concerning the starting *voltage*.
