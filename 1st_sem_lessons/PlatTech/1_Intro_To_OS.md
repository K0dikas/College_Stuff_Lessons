- An *operating system (OS)* utilizes hardware resources of one or more processors to provide a wide range of service to system users.
- Manages the secondary memory and the *I/O* devices. `Stallings, 2018`
- An *OS* involves software and files that are installed on a computer so that it can boot and execute programs.

- An *OS* makes a computer convenient to use
- An *OS* allows computer resources to be utilized n an efficient manner
- *OS* are generally constructed to effectively support the development, testing, and implementation of new system functions or software applications.

###### OS provides services:
- **Program development** - The *OS* provides a variety of facilities and services in the form of *utility programs*, such as editors and debuggers, for program development, which is also referred to as application program development tools.
- **Program execution** - The *OS* handles different processes, such as loading data into the memory and scheduling, which must be performed to execute programs.
- **Access to I/O devices** - The *OS* provides a uniform interface that hides complex sets of instructions for *I/O devices'* operations.
- **Control access to files** - The *OS* encompasses a detailed understanding of the structure of data contained in a `file storage` and can provide some `protection mechanisms` to `control file access`.
- **System resource access** - The *OS* control `access to the whole system` and to some specific `system resources` through access functions and authorizations..
- **Error detection and response** - The *OS* can detect errors, such as device failure and software errors.
- **Performance parameter monitoring** - The *OS* must collect usage statistics from various processes, such as response time, that can be used as a basis for system performance improvements.
- **Instruction Set Architecture** - The *ISA* defines the collection of machine language instructions that a computer can follow.
- **Application Binary Interface (ABI)** - The *ABI* defines a standard for binary portability across programs. System call interface to the *OS* and the *hardware resources*.
- **Application Program Interface (API)** - The *API* allows a program to the hardware resources and services available in a system through that *ISA*, supplemented with high-level-language library calls. It also enables easier porting of application software.
