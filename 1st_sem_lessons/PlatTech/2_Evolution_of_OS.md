###### Serial Processing
- From late `1940s` to the `mid-1950s`, programmers interact directly with computer hardware since *OS* are not yet available.
- *Serial Processing* presented two main problems:
	- **Scheduling** - Installations used a hardcopy sign-up sheet to reserve computer time.
	- **Set-up Time** - A single program, called a *job*, involves numerous sequenced set-up processes that involve mounting and dismounting of tapes and setting up card decks.

###### Simple Batch Systems
- To improve processor utilization, the concept of batch operating system was developed in the `mid-1950s` by *General Motors Research Laboratories*.
- The main idea is the utilization of a piece of program know as the *monitor* or *resident monitor*.

###### Multi-programmed Batch Systems
- This kind of *OS* is more `sophisticated` compared to single programmed systems.

###### Time-sharing Systems
- Multiple users simultaneously `access the system through terminals`.

###### Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)
- One of the *first time-sharing OS systems* that was developed.
- Developed by **Massachusetts Institute Of Technology** `(MIT)` by the group *project MAC*, for the `IBM 709` computer system.
