###### Spanish Colonization
- **Junk** - Trading boat.
- Each barangay had a *datu*, `the leader`, and `prime defender` of the community.
- **Casta** - The `taxation system`. The *casta* is divided into sections, which dictated their tax value.

|  | `Peninsulares` | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tax-Free** | `Americano` |
|  | `Insulares` |
|  |  | `Mestizo de Espanol` |
|  |  | `Mestizo de Bombay` |
| **Variable Tax Value** | *Mestizaje* | `Mestizo de Sangley` |
||  | `Tornatras` |
|  |  |
| **Quadrupled Tax Value** | `Sangley` |
| **Base Tax Value** | `Indio` | 
|  | `Negrito` |

- **Filipinos** and **Negritos** pay only the `base value`, making them the only ones who pay the minimum amount.
- **Sangleys** are the `pure-blooded Chinese` who lived in the country. They pay to quadruple the base amount because of their business and labor skills.
- **Mestizaje** is the racially ambiguous people who paid tax based on their `lineage` and `status`.
	- *Ex:* if a `Sangley` businessman had a *mestiza de Sangley*, daughter would pay half as much as her father's tax rate.
	- However, should the mestiza daughter marry an *Americano*, who paid zero tax alongside the *Insulares* and the *Peninsulares*, her tax would be removed altogether.
	- However, the treatment she would receive from the masses would *remain the same*.
- **Indians** also lived in the country, but they were not part of the *casta*.
- Below the `blancos` *(i.e., the "tax-free" casta)* were the *mestizaje*, whose casta were based on their parentage.
- `Mixed blood` by nature, their status often fluctuated, and their taxes were the same as the *Indios*, `(except for the mestizo be Sangleys)`.
- Of the *four* `4` *mestizos*, the *Tornatras* were the lowest b ecause they had more than *two* `2` racial parentages, hinting that the *Tornatras* had the most intermingling of races.

- Along with the establishment of the *casta* was the implementation of the *polo* and the *bandala*.
- **Polo** is the `forced labor` imposed upon Filipino men aged `16-60 years`.
- They were required to do `skilled labor` for `40 days`, which was reduced to `15 days`. Filipinos can be exempted from this labor in *two* `(2)` ways:
	1. They had to pay a fine, `falla`; or
	2. Work until they paid their *debt*.
- Not even death could prevent the debt from growing. If the abled men `died`, their unpaid debt would be *passed on* to the next abled men in the family, and so on. If the able person's age was below the requirement, yet their birthday drew close to the recruitment date, then they would render *polo* nonetheless.


###### The History of Land Ownership and Peasantry in the Philippines
- During Rizal's education in the Philippines, *Paciano* provided ample funding for his younger brother to study abroad. *This made Rizal a member of the ilustrado*, an `expatriate` whose sole purpose *abroad was to study*. However, when Rizal arrived and settled in Europe, problems began to rise in *Calamba* regarding the lands owned by his family. The problems with agrarian ownership have been a long-standing problem in the country, which was more evident during the Spanish Occupation. This was when the *local serfs* `(i.e., the aliping namamahay)` were stripped of their lands by the Spaniards, who used these lands for their own. These lands were cultivated by the same natives who were once the former owners. Such problems began to expound when friars became the owners, particularly in Negros and *Calamba*. In *Calamba*, the *Dominicans* began to exploit the natives with their `ever-fluctuating tax values`. This was viewed by the *Calambe√±os* as abusive and began to argue with the abusive Dominicans -- especially when they grabbed the lands owned by the *Mercados*. They at first appealed to the local government but were ignored due to the influence of the Dominicans in the place. Thus, they prompted Rizal to `conduct an investigation`, whose reports would be submitted to a local judge connected to *Paciano* to even the odds. However, in the end, their protestations fell onto deaf ears.


###### The Cavite Mutiny
- The Cavite Mutiny was *one* `(1)` of the *aftermaths of the civil war* that erupted in Spain *during Queen Isabella II's reign*. On `27 February 1767`, *King Carlos III of Spain* ordered the *complete expulsion of the sect of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) from Spain* and all her colonies. Then *Governor-General Raon* tried to help the religious order in exchange for bribes. Once the *Jesuits destroyed their documents and hid all their possessions*, there was a shortage of priests when *Raon* died before being punished by his successor. Then *Manila archbishop Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa* spearheaded the conversion and ordainment of Filipinos into the priesthood, which was heavily opposed. This argument came to be known as the **secularization** issue. Back then, news traveled slowly. When then *Governor-General Carlos Maria de la Torre* was still in the country, he received a letter about his reinstatement without knowing about the civil war in Spain. Upon his departure, his liberal program was stunted upon the sudden arrival of *Rafael Geronimo Cayetano Izquierdo*. *Izquierdo* noted that he would rule the Philippines `"with a cross in one hand and a sword in the other".` Thus, with a strict regime, the lives of the Filipinos began to crumble. When the mutiny occurred, the Spanish friars accused Filipino priest Jose Burgos, along with a few other secular priests, to be the masterminds of the event, despite being truly driven by the Filipinos' desires of escaping polo in Cavite, the `"Land of the Brave"`. Due to the friar's influence, *three* `(3)` *Filipino priests* -- *Mariano Gomez*, *Burgos*, and *Jacinto Zamora* -- were implicated in the trial by another fellow Filipino, *Francisco Zaldua* (Saldua in other references). This event, among many others, `paved the way to drive out Spain.`
