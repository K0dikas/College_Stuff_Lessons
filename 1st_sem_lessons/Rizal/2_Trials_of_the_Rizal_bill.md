- *Republic Act No. 1495* - `Rizal Law`
- When it was filed on *April 3, 1956* by the **Committee of Education**, a former committee in the legislation, under the name *Senate Bill No. 438* with only three (3) lawmakers earned its support:
	- `Senator Claro M. Recto` - *Author*
	- `Senator Jose P. Laurel` - *Sponsored by*

- According to *Senator Laurel*, by reading *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*, it will disseminate the ideas and ideals of *Jose Rizal*, know to be a great patriot.
- According to the *Catholic Church*, they `disagree` because it contain elements that discredit the `religion` and its `tenets`. It `violates` the religious freedom.
- It was opposed all of because of just an *alleged pastoral letter* that branded the novels as `heretical` and `impious`: (`skeptic` , `ungodly`). But the *pastoral letter's* authenticity was questioned.

###### Supporting side
- **First Debate**:
	- Supported by:
		- `Senator Claro M. Recto`
		- `Senator Laurel`
	- Opposed by:
		- `Senator Mariono J. Cuenco`
		- `Senator Francisco Rodrigo`
		- `Senator Decoroso Rosales`
- `Senator Recto` said that the *objective of the bill* is to foster appreciation of *Rizal's times* and played a major role to combat *Spanish Tyranny*. It did not pretend to *teach religion* or *theology*. *Rizal* aimed to have Filipinos become aware of their society and instill in them the *national dignity*, *personal pride*, and *patriotism*.

- If references to the *misdeeds* of the church and its ministers had bee shown in the novels, it was then to shed light on what the country was back then -- *Rizal simply narrated what had been*.

###### Opposition side
- The *opposition* on the other hand, reading the novels is against their *religious convictions*. They are in need for *unity*, which would be `upended` by the signing of the bill. 
- `Senator Rodrigo`, remarked that the majority of Filipinos have *two great loves*: their *country* and their *faith*. They do not conflict with one another, they are *harmonious affections*, like the love of a child for his father and for his mother.
- `Senator Rodrigo` also said that *nationalism* and *religion*, *government* and *church*, must not be in conflict with one another.

###### House of Representatives
- *April 19, 1956*, `Congressman Jacobo z. Gonzales` introduced another bill, *House Bill No. 5561*, which was an identical copy of *Senate Bill No. 438*
- This *bill* however, led to the condition imposed that if a student's beliefs were to be *compromised* while taking the subject, then they can be granted an exemption by the university. 
- The *bill* was to be adjourned *sine die* (i.e. in indefinite time) since it has to be printed and disseminated to the entire Congress within *three days*.
- Both *Senate bill No. 438* and *House Bill 5561* were `approved` upon *third reading* on *May 17*.
