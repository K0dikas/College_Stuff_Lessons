- *Recto's belief* that the reading of *Rizal's novels* would strengthen the *Filipinism* of the youth and foster *patriotism*.
- The *Catholic Hierarchy*, spearheaded in the Senate by `Senator Decoroso Rosales`, brother of Archbishop, now `Cardinal Cuenco`; and `Senator Francisco Rodrigo`, former president of Catholic action.
- They said that it violates *freedom of conscience and religion*.
- They issued a *pastoral letter* detailing its objections to the bill and enjoining Catholics to *oppose* it.
- They proposed a *closed door conference* with the Catholic hierarchy.

###### Symposium and Open forum
- Under the auspices of the *Catholic Action of Manila*. 
- Two announcement are made:
	- *Sentinel* would be published daily instead of weekly.
	- *Filipino Catholic* would be urged to write their congressman and senators asking them to *kill* the Rizal bill.
- `Fr. Jesus Cavanna` said that the novels *belong to the past* and it would be *harmful* to read them because they represented a *false picture* of the condition of the country at that time.
- *Noli Me Tangere* as an *attack on the clergy*, and it would ridicule the Catholic faith.
- Only `25 contained patriotic passages` out of `333 pages` while `120` were devoted to  *anti-catholic attacks*.
- `Jesus Paredes`, a radio commentator, said that the Catholics had the right to refuse to read them as not to *endanger their salvation*, because for him, some parts of the novels had been declared *objectionable matter*.
- `Narciso Pimentel, Jr`, another radio commentator, said the reason for all of this is `Recto's revenge` against the Catholic voters who, together with `Magsaysay`, were responsible for his poos showing in the `1955` senatorial elections.


- In a *three hour long speech*, `Recto` attacked the *hierarchy of the Catholic Church* for its *pastoral letter*. 
- The *pastoral letter* cited only *170 passages* from the *Noli Me Tangere* and *50* from *El Fili*.

- `Rodrigo` said *"I cannot allow my son who is now 16 to read the Noli Me Tangere and the El Filibusterismo lest he lose his faith"*
- `Recto` charged that these *laudatory phrases were being used* to *"hide the real intentions of the pastoral which is to separate the people from Rizal"*
- A threat that *Catholic schools* would close should the *Rizal bill pass*, `Recto` went on record in  favor of the *nationalization* of all schools.
- He contended that *nationalization might just be just the step needed to foster a more vibrant nationalism* among Filipinos. 
- He did not really believe the threat. *"They are making too much profit which they can ill-afford to give up"*

- On *May 3*, in a privilege speech, he recalled that during the days of Rizal, religious orders dominated the government. *"Is this a new attempt to deliver the State to the Church"*.
- `Bishop Manuel Yap` had warned that legislators who voted for the *Rizal bill* would be *punished* in the next election.
- `Recto` took the floor for the *seventh time* to warn against church interference in state affairs. He branded `Yap` as the *"moderately Torquemada"*.

- Finally, on *May 12*, *unanimous approval* of a substitute measure authored by `Senator Laurel` and based on the proposals `Senator roseller T. Lim` and `Senator Emmanuel Pelaez.`
- The *bill* as passed was clearly an accommodation to the objections of the *Catholic hierarchy and Laurel said as much*.
- Though it still provided that the basic texts in the collegiate courses should be the unexpurgated editions of the two novels, it was *now possible* for students to be exempted from using the unexpurgated editions on grounds of *religious belief*.
- On *June 12, 1956*, the bill was signed by `President Ramon Magsaysay`.
