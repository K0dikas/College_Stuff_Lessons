###### The Expatriates
- **Overseas Filipino Workers** `OFW`
- **Expatriates**, `greek` meaning `"beyond, outside"` + `"father"`, `"beyond the  father's abode"`
- We had been *sending* `expatriates` since the *Spanish Occupation*, which can be seen in the `ilustrados`.
	- **Ilustrados** - during their tenure abroad, sought and campaigned for reform in the colonial government.
		1. The idea of the *indios* developing *anticlerical thoughts* was considered a `crime`. This made some prominent people move out of the country to escape *persecution*.
			*Ex:* `Jose Rizal`. He was *expatriated* by his brother `Paciano` because Jose earned the wrath of the friars.
		2. The advent of industrialization paved the way for more ideas to move from Europe to the other parts of the world, with the *opening of the Suez Canal* being *one* `1` of these.
		3. The governments were beginning to *modernize* because of the *changing times*. The *ilustrados* saw this as an opportunity to campaign their proposed reforms.
- The **ilustrados** came from *all casta*, save for outsiders such as *Indians* and *Muslims*.
- `Trinidad Pardo de Tavera` *insular*
- `the Lunas` *mestizo de Espanol*
- `Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda` *mestizo de Sangley*
- `Rizal` famous phrase in his speech for `Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo`:
- *The Philippines' patriarchal era is passing. The illustrious deeds of its sons are not circumscribed by the home. The oriental chrysalis is [leaving] the cocoon"* .

###### Deconstructing Noli Me Tangere
- `Crisostomo Ibarra`, as he strode through the intrigue and suffering of his brethren and of himself in a society where the friars held absolute dominion over the colonized land.
- *Latin* - *Noli Me Tangere* - `Touch Me Not`
- *Internationally,* `"The Social Cancer"` by *Charles Derbyshire*
- Originally *published* in `1887` in *Europe*, it took all of `Rizal's money`, `time`, and `effort` to do this.
- It was supposed to be a *collection of stories* made by him and his `ilustrado` friends that would provide a window to the *slice-of-life* tales in the Philippines.
- But, due to them procrastinating, `Rizal` was offended and took it upon himself to write the book.
- The novel has `63` *known chapters*, but *some modern-day books* used in junior high schools `feature a copy` of the novel with an *extra hidden chapter* `explaining the origin of Elias (Rizal, 1887).` This is in part of Rizal writing the chapter but left unmarked *because he did not know where to place it in the established continuum of Noli Me Tangere*.

###### Parts of the story
- **Protagonist** 
	- A character that plays an important part in the story regardless of their role.
	- *good guys* in the story
	- `Crisostomo Ibarra`
- **Antagonist**
	- A character that provides *conflict* to the story, usually assigned to the *villains of the story*.
	- `corrupt friars`, `Dominicans`, `Franciscans`, and the members of the `blancos`, which are the top *three* `3` of the *Spanish casta system*.

###### Genre
- is the *element* `that drives the story` . It can be based on *reality* or in a *completely made-up world*. *Noli Me Tangere*, as a novel, is considered both as a *fiction* and *satire*.
	- `Fiction` - A story that is *not found* or *based on reality*
		- Can be a *completely made-up world*, *scenarios*, and *people*
	- `Satire` - Uses *exaggeration*, *humor*, *irony*, or *ridicule* to `expose human stupidity` or `vices`.
		- This is an excellent genre to use if the story revolves around `politics`, or `major issues`.
		- *Noli Me Tangere* satirizes the *Roman Catholic Church*, *the Colonial government*, and the *peninsulares*.

###### Morals in Noli Me Tangere
- **The Filipina's devotion and influence over a man.** This has been exemplified by several Filipinas in the novel, but it has been demonstrated the best by Maria Clara. As the true love of Crisostomo Ibarra, she has shown grace and simple elegance through her actions and words, leaving a strong impression over young men in their place. 

- **A deep sense of gratitude.** Noli Me Tangere exemplified this trait through the eyes of several poor and indebted characters, particularly Basilio. As he was left orphaned, he was left in the care of Elias until the latter's death, leaving him with wealth that could afford him to study through college. 

- **Filipino Common Sense.** The novel inadvertently has woken up the Filipinos' sleeping sense of nationalism and, as such, opened their eyes to the bitter reality happening around them. This led us to use our common sense more and be more aware of the current events in the country.

###### So why did Rizal write the novels?
- **Disprove accusations made by Spaniards to Filipinos.** The novel depicted Filipinos as seen from the lenses of the freeman, living normal lives and experiencing problems similar to the affluent, if not worse. 
- **Express the true social conditions of the country.** Since the Age of Exploration has limited forms of communication, many countries do not know what was happening outside their borders. Since the Philippines had been campaigning for recognition in the Cortes Generales and the Real Audiencia, the ilustrados used several means to express the true social conditions of the country, which also include the novels.
- **Express the plight of the Filipinos.** Since the majority of indios could not afford to speak out in public nor travel abroad to escape persecution, the Filipinos were living in conditions filled with strife, injustices, and hardships. Those that do either were executed in public or went abroad, as in the case of some ilustrados.
- **Expose the wrongdoings of the friars.** Some of the friars had been known to use their religious influences to manipulate things to go to their favor, such as using religious teachings to gain more resources. The ilustrados wanted to expose these villainous and heinous acts committed by some members of the church; thus, they also used the novels to expose them.

###### Another thing  a literary material can be used is to spread awareness and nationalism
- `Andres Bonifacio`, as a *bourgeois*, was well-versed in Western thinking and literature because of his work in the British trade and in the books he read. When he scoured *Noli Me Tangere*, he was moved and stirred to do something about the *injustices* that were happening to his fellowmen. When he formed the *Katipunan*, he composed and published the very first *Kartilya ng Katipunan*. `Emilio Jacinto` later revised it, to `Bonifacio's` delight and approval.
- `Marcelo Del Pilar`, upon learning that *Noli Me Tangere* was to be banned for publication in the Philippines, wrote a counter article to the one written by `Fr. Jose Rodriguez`.`Rodriguez` wrote *"Caingat Cayo"* `(Beware)`, an article that supposedly tried to denounce *Noli Me Tangere's* credibility as a novel. As retaliation, `del Pilar` wrote *"Caiigat Cayo!"* `(Be slippery as an eel)`, which satirizes `Rodriguez's article` while adding a few insults to their practices in the church.
- `Lualhati Bautista` wrote the novel *Dekada '70*, which retold the story of `Martial Law` through the eyes of the family who was caught up in the corruption and abuse of power during *Marcos' regime*. This and other similar stories and/or novels as a reminder to us of the darker times in Philippine history.
