**HCI Principles** are general and applicable to wide areas and aspects of human-computer interaction design, while `guidelines` tend to be more specfic.

- *Guidelines* are a set of information intended to advise people on how something should be done or what something should be.
- `Straightforward and easy to understand` but `difficult to incorporate in actual design and implementation`.

- **HCI guidelines** are a set of recommended information used to direct *HCI design and development*.
- More detailed than *HCI Principles*

| **Criteria** | **Categories** | **Example** |
|----|----|----|
| `General HCI Design` | Display layout, general aesthetic, user experience | Combining colors in designing a website, size of an icon |
| `User Type` | Age/generation, culture, gender, occupation | Kids, baby boomers, students, athletes |
| `Platform/System` | Mobile, desktop, embedded, OS, VR | Smartphones, desktop, kiosk, embedded OS | 
| `Vendor/Organization` | Private, public, design/identity | NASA, iOS, Android, Windows XP |
| `Interface Style/Modality` | Windows, icon, mouse | Voice, gesture, multitouch, GUI/widgets |
| `Task/Operational Context` | Location, time, noice/lighting | Office, outdoor, home, automobile, subway |
| `Applications` | Game, media, e-commerce, design/editing, social network service | interactive interface of *Facebook*, Interface of *Adobe Photoshop* |

##### Examples of HCI Principles
###### Visual Display Layout (General HCI Design)
- **Display layout**, or *page layout*, is one of the focus of design guidelines.
- This concerns the organization of *relevant information*, both content and user interface elements, in one visible screen or a scrollable page.
- HCI Guidelines by *U.S Department of Health and Human Services for the U.S government*:
	- `Align items on a page`
	- `Avoid cluttered display`
	- `Place important items consistently`
	- `Place important items at top center`
	- `Set appropriate page lengths`
	- `Choose appropriate line lengths`
###### Taking User Input (General HCI Design)
- Crafty designs for taking user input, such as raw information and system commands, can improve the overall performance, especially time and accuracy, for high interactive systems.

###### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Is an *interface* through which a user interacts with electronic devices such as computers, mobile devices, and other appliances.
- `Button`, `text box`, `menu`, `forms`, `icons`.
- *HCI Guidelines*:
	- `Minimal input action by the user`
	- `Minimal memory load on users`
	- `Design of forms and dialog boxes`
	- `compatibility of data entry with data display`
	- `Consistency of data-entry actions`

###### User with Disability (User Type)
- The *World Wide Web Consortium* `(W3C)`, an international community where organization staff and the public work together to develop web standards.
- Published *Web Content Accessibility Guidelines* `(WCAG) 2.1` in `2018` .
- This set of guidelines covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities.
- Here is a *summary* of the guidelines:
	- **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be presentable in ways users can perceive.
		- Provide a text alternative for non-text context.
		- Provide alternatives for time-based media.
		- Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure.
		- Make it easier for the user to see and hear content.
	- **Operable** - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
		- Make all  functionality available from a keyboard.
		- Give users enough time to read and use content.
		- Do not design content a a way that is known to cause seizure or physical reactions.
		- Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
		- Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond the keyboard.
	- **Understandable** - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
		- Make text content readable and understandble.
		- Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
		- Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
	- **Robust** - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
		- `Maximize` compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

###### Mobile Device (Platform Type)
- Smartphones are widely used nowadays. Usability and other user experience of mobile devices and applications have become more important.
- *Summarized* HCI Guidelines by *Tidwell*:
	- Fast status info, such as network connection and services
	- Minimize tying and control on mixed input like buttons, touch, voice, handwriting recognition, virtual keyboard, etc.
	- Intense task focus to lessen confusion in a highly dense information space
	- Large hit targets for an easy and correct selection and manipulation
	- Efficient use of screen space.
