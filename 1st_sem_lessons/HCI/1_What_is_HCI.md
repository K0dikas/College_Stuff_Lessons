- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** - is a `cross-disciplinary` area that deals with the `theory`, `design`, `implementation`, and `evaluation` of ways human use and interact with `computing devices`
- **HCI** uses `productivity`, `safety`, and `entertainment` to support and fulfill human-computer activities.
- **HCI** has become `more important` in recent years as computers have become part of a human's daily routine.
	- *High usability* is the interactive design and operations through specific computer system criteria which include `correctness`, `efficiency`, `safety`, `utility`, `learning`, and `retention`.
	- *User experience* focuses on creating systems that enhance the overall involvement of a person, which must include a `satisfying`, `enjoyable`, `entertaining`, `helpful`, `motivating`, `aesthetically pleasing`, and `fun experience` to the user.

- *Human-computer interaction* is important.
- Usable and efficient interaction with different computing devices translates to higher productivity in any industry.
- Below are some *noticeable impacts*:
	- `The spreadsheet interface made business computing a success.`
	- `The Internet phenomenon could not have happened without the Web-browser interface.`
	- `Smartphones and other mobile devices are widely used today.`
	- `Body-based and action-oriented interfaces are now being used to play and enjoy computer games.`
##### Principles of HCI
###### Know the user
- Commonly know as *"user-centered design"*, this principle serves as the *primary principle of HCI*.
- Basic information such as `gender`, `age`, `educaction level`, and `computing experience` are collected and analyze.
- *Ex:* Knowing the age bracket, profiling the target user, conducting a survey

###### Understand the Task
- Another *plausible principle* of HCI.
- The term *"task"* refers to the job to be accomplished by the user with the interactive system.
- `Interaction modelling` and `user analysis`.
- *Ex:* Conceptual model, formulating an interaction model, analyzing the user's capability

###### Reduce Memory Load
- Humans are more efficient in performing tasks that require `light memory load`, either for *long term* or *short term memory*.
- Keeping the user's short term memory load light is important in relation to the interface's role as a quick and easy guide to complete a task.
- The capacity of *humans's short term memory* is about `five (5) to nine (9)` specific information with respect to the completion of a task.
- *Light memory load* also leads to `less erroneous behavior`.
- *Ex:* Keeping the number of menu items to a lesser quantity, keyboard shortcuts for copy and pasting

###### Strive for Consistency
- A way to *relieve long term memory load* of a user is to strive  for consistency.
- Multiple tabs.
- A user has a higher tendency to be confused and exhibit inaccurate and inappropriate responses if the *same subtask* is involved at a different time.
- *Ex:* A consistent look of the interface within a gaming application, A consistent interface between MS PPT and MS Word.

###### Remind Users
- A significant task involves the *use of memory*.
- Another strategy is to *employ interfaces* that *provide constant reminders about important information* or *actions to be performed and thus refresh the user's memory*.
- `Feedback` is an event that occurs when the output of a system is used as an input back into the system as part of a chain of events.
- *Ex:* Confirming the safe receipt of a credit card number in an online payment, Reminding the user to perform a system update on a computer

###### Prevent Errors/Reversal of Action
- In performing any given task, it is important to complete the task *without any error*.
- The interaction and the interface should be designed to *avoid confusion and overwork of users*.
- *Ex:* Confirming the user's action and displaying large interactive processes through pop-up menus, reversal action like the `undo button`, Presenting only the relevant information at a given time and making selections

###### Natural Interaction and Interface
- To favor *natural interaction and interfaces*.
- Refers to the reflection of various actions and processes in human's daily life.
- At some point, it can be complicated to `translate` *real-life actions and other modes of interaction to interact with a computer directly*, but it is achievable.
- *Ex:* The natural interactive interface of *Wii* and *Pokemon GO*.
