###### Human Problem-Solving Model
- Consists of these *four (4) important parts*:
	- **Sensation** - Senses external information through `aural`, `haptic`, or `visual modality`
	- **Perception** - `Interprets` and `extracts` basic meanings for the external information
	- **Memory** - *stores short-term* or *long-term information* about external `procedures`, `rules`, `relations`, `schemas`, and the `likes`
	- **Decision/Executor** - *formulates* and *revises* a `solution` or `plan`, decides based on various information in the memory, and finally acts it out by commanding the motor system.

###### Human Reaction and Prediction of Cognitive Performance
- Introduced by `Donald Norman`.
-  **Gulf of Execution** - Is the difference between the intentions of the users and what the system allows them to do or how well the system supports those actions.
- **Gulf of Evaluation** - Is the degree to which the system provides representations that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of user expectations and intentions. 

###### GOMS Model
- Stands for `goals`, `operators`, `methods`, and `selection rules`
- A *human information processing model* that predicts what skilled users will do in a seemingly unpredictable situation.
	- **Goals** - These are tasks that a user wants to accomplish.
	- **Operators** - These are the basic perceptual, cognitive, or motor actions used to accomplish goals or actions allowed by the system.
	- **Methods** - These involve a sequence of procedures that can accomplish a goal.
	- **Selection Rules** - These are personal rules users follow in selecting a method to be used.

###### Sensation and Perception of Information
- **Visual Modality** - The most important information medium today.
- *Over 40% of the human brain* is involved in processing visual information.
- *Visual and Display Parameters*:
	- `Field of View (FOV)` - The observable area a person can through the eyes
	- `Viewing distance` - The distance from the eyes to the surface of the display
	- `Display field of view` - The area subtended by the display from a particular viewing distance
	- `Pixel` - Small rectangular areas which compose a display system
	- `Display resolution` - The number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions for a fixed area
	- `Visual acuity` - The resolution perceived by the eye from a fixed distance
- *Visual Quality Attributes*:
	- `Brightness` - The amount of light emitted by an object or as perceived by the human eye
	- `Color` - The human response to different wavelengths of light, namely for those corresponding to red, green, blue, and their mixture
	- `Contrast` - The relative difference in brightness or color between two (2) objects

###### Aural Modality
 - The next *most common mode of information feedback*
 - Recommended sound signal should be between `50` and `5000Hz`
 - *Aural Display Parameters*:
	 - `Intensity` - Also known as *volume*, this refers to the amount of sound energy.
	 - `Sound` - This is the *energy* transmitted in the forms of waves with different frequencies.
	 - `Phase` - This refers to the time differences among sound waves that originates from the same source.
- *Input Method, two (2) major methods*:
	- `Speech Recognition` - This is the ability of a machine or a program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format.
	- `Natural Language Understanding` - It is a branch of *AI* that uses computer software to understand input made in the form of sentence in text or speech format.

- **Haptic Modality** - Considered as a natural way of interacting with computers.
- *"haptic"* pertains to the technology that uses touch to control and interact with computers.

- **Multimodal Interaction** - Has been advancing in the industry with the ubiquity of multimedia devices.
	- `Complementary` - Different modalities can adopt different roles and act in *complementary manner* to accomplish specific interaction objectives.
	- `Redundant` - Different input method or feedback can be used to guarantee a definitive accomplishment of the interaction objectives.
	- `Alternatives` - Provides users with alternative ways to interact **gives users more options**.

###### Human Body Ergonomics
- Also known as **motor capabilities**.
- The term **ergonomics** pertains to the discipline focused on creating products and interfaces which are comfortable and efficient to use.

- **Fitts' Law** is a model of human movement that predicts the time required to move rapidly to a target area as a function of the distance to the size of the target.

- **Motor Control** - Another method of initiating and performing voluntary movement.
- Humans exhibit different motor control practices with different devices.
- The most predominant form of input made is made by movement of `arms`, `hands`, and `fingers` for keyboard and mouse input.
